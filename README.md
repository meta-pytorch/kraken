#### A Triton library of Symmetric Memory operators and examples.

</div>

This repository aims to simplify the process of developing distributed AI models using Triton and PyTorch's symmetric memory capabilities. Our initial kernels are adapted from the [Symmetric Memory Recipes](https://github.com/yifuwang/symm-mem-recipes) by Yifu Wang.

## Examples
TBD

## Requirements
Kraken requires:
* Triton >= 3.3.0
* PyTorch >= 2.6.0
* Python >= 3.10

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pytorch-labs/kraken
cd kraken
pip install -e . -r requirements.txt
```
